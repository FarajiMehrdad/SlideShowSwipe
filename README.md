[Draft] [In progress] Slide show with gesture control -- Android custom view

The task is to create slide show in connection with mutable image container. It means that images doesn't form fixed list there--they can be added into any position of container and be rearranged at any time, and the view isn't allowed to appear broken or demonstrate any kind of abnormal behavior.

Simple gesture recognition should be implemented to allow user to pause slide show demonstration and explore images like in Android gallery, using left/right swipes.
